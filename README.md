## The standard firmware from Crow Runner 8/16 Ip Module will NOT work with this code in HA, NO support of such versions!!
## In order to get that module running you must ensure that the deconditions are fulfilled:
### That will be:
- Use Crow Runner 8/16 connected to an IP module from Crow for this alarm system.
- Using firmware Ver 2.10.3628 2017 Oct 20 09:48:43 on the IP module
- Not having ANY SSH connection active to that IP Module (Firmware support just a single connection ) to SSH port 5002.
- WebUi can be reached with IP adress that is given in the first Bootup via DHCP Server.
- Set the IP adress to static in order to keep a fixed IP adress at any time.
- Running Home Assistant higher then release 2024.01.0 (lower once mayowrk but are not support):

### An setup example is given below: (config_flow setup is in progress)
